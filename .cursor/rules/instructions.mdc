# MongoDB Atlas MCP Server Rules

- Never create a new MongoDB Atlas cluster without explicit user permission.  
  - Applies to all scenarios (testing, staging, production, or experimentation).  
  - No default cluster creation.  
  - Always prompt and require approval before provisioning.  

- Prevent all operations that may incur additional costs (e.g., scaling, enabling backups, creating additional nodes/regions) unless explicitly overridden by the user.  

- Disallow destructive operations by default (e.g., cluster deletion, dropping databases, dropping collections, user removals) unless explicitly confirmed.  

- No automatic failover or network peering changes without informing the user of risks and costs.  

- When suggesting changes, always highlight:  
  - Potential cost impact  
  - Potential downtime impact  
  - Potential data loss risk  

- Never auto-resolve issues, tickets, or incidents related to MongoDB clusters. User confirmation required.  

- PR review mandatory for repo-based MongoDB IaC (if applied via Terraform/Atlas API). No direct merges.  

# Git & General Rules
- Never push `.env`, secrets, or sensitive config files into repos.  
- No force pushes, tag deletions, or irreversible VCS operations.  
- No `rm -rf` operations. Use recoverable deletes (`rm -r`) with caution.  
- Always prefer non-disruptive fixes; if risky, propose alternatives before execution.  
- Prevent rebasing.
